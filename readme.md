# How my dot files are managed: 
Thank you [internet](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797) for giving me a set up that will work to put all of my dot files under VC. 

Note that for this repo only you have to use `config` instead of `git`. Also, since the entire home directory is technically under VC, don't run recursive git commands here.
